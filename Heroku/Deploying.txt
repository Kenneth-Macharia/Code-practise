A.INTRO:
-Heroku is a distributed web service for hosting apps and other resources e.g websites.
-It allows end users to interact with the deployed app.
-Heroku allocates a dyno (a virtual machine) to allow the app to run on. Multiple
  dynos can improve the app performance but extras will have to be paid for.
-Caching layers, which can also improve the app performance are not allowed
  on Heroku.
-uWSGI will also be availed to serve the app.
-We can also setup configs for the app as well as log settings.
-Heroku also offers Secure Socket Layer (SSL) thus communications between the app
  and clients will be secured.
-A free Heroku account allows 1 dyno per app and limited running time for the dyno.

B.DEPLOYING: (See heroku_deployment branch for the project deployment version)
-Create a free Heroku account.
-Create a new app and select a run region, based on where most users of the app are located.
-Connect Github: Deploy > connect Github and select a repo to deploy from.
-Before deployment, ensure to have the following files in your project root:
  1.requirements.txt (a list of all the app dependancies). To generate, run at the
    prompt, while in the app virtual environment $pip freeze > requirements.txt
  2.runtime.txt (will contain > the app python version e.g. 'python 2.7.15')
  3.uwsgi.ini (uwsgi config file to tell Heroku how to run uwsgi for the app)
  4.Procfile (specify what dyno to use)
-Select a build package: Settings > Add build package
-Set up heroku to either deploy manually or automatically, and the branch to deploy.
-Ensure successful deployment and launch of the app.

C.HEROKU TROUBLESHOOTING:
-This would usually be after the app crushed on Heroku, after attempting to run it.
-On heroku devcenter, download and install the Heroku CLI for the appropriate OS.
-If terminal wa running during installation, restart it.
-Run $heroku login and enter Heroku credentials to log in.
-Once logged, in extract an error log: $heroku logs --app=<app name on Heroku>

-For our app, we have fixes to app.py to ensure our app (store-items-restful-api) runs:
  1.Error : db_obj in app.py is not defined, because it's being imported only if
    app.py is run as __main__. uWSGI on Heroku runs the app object not the file so
    db_obj which enables SQLAlchemy to set up the database, is never imported.
  2.Fix : Create a run.py and import db_obj from slqalchemy & the app object from
   app.py. Include the 'db_obj.init_app(app)' and move the create_all() function
   and it's decorator here. The change uswgi.ini to run the app in run.py (run:app)
    as opposed to the app in the app module (app:app).
