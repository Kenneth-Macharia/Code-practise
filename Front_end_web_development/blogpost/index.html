      This is a very <strong>strong</strong> text, coz its <strong>bold</strong>
      Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
      Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. <br> Separated they
      live in <em>this is emphasized</em> Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of
      the Semantics, alarge language ocean. <br>A small river named Duden flows
      by their place and supplies it with the necessary <u>regelialia</u>. It is
      a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly
      into your mouth.

      Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
      Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they
      live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
      large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their
      place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
      paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly
      into your mouth.
