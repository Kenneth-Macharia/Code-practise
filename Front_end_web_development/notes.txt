-Colors are represented by the RGB model on a range between 0 - 255 for either
 color.
 -Hexadecimal values (#xxxxx) are used to pick any color combination of the 3 primary colors
  to yield any desired color.
-rgb values can also be used to pick any color as well but have also an option
 for color transparency. {rgb(31,61,0,0.48) > Red-31, Green-61, Blue-0, 48% transparency}

-A class can be used to style as many elements as required, but I.ds can only be
 used once in the same HTML document. Class use is more encouraged even when we
  only have one class.
