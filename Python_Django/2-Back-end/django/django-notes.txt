- Is a python web development framework.
- It is used to map a user requested url to code that is meant to handle it, then using templates, cresate the requested html dynamically, then fetch requested data from a database and inject it to the generated html to dipslay to the user. It is thus an interface between the front and back end.
- Developed in 2003 by web dev at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, when they started using python for their dev work. Because of its writer influenced origin, good documentation is key to django and it has elaborate documentations to reference.
- Using a virtual env with django apps is improtant so us to not break compatibility with the current web app, when testing out updated python packages the web app relies on.
- By using a venv, you isolate packages for a specific app away from the those of another app.
- Create a venv using conda or pip (see for flask projects), for conda run:

	conda create --name venv_name django. # Meaning create a venv called venv_name and initialize it as a django package.

(NB) The above command may try to install python 2 by default, so instead create the venv as a python 3 package first instead (check what will be installed first)

	conda create --name venv_name python=3.7 # View the packages to be installed and confirm the correct version, the proceed with init.


(NB) Run conda info --envs  # To view all venv present

- Django provides a command line tool called django-admin to easily manage django projects e.g

	# To create a new django project run: 

		django-admin startproject project_name 

	Which initializes a new project folder with some files in them:

		1. __init__.py :tells python that this folder is a python package and can be imported.
		2. settings.py :all settings for the project
		3. urls.py :stores all url patterns of the project i.e the various pages for the web app
		4. wsgi.py :web server gateway interface used during the app deployment
		5. manage.py :Associated with alot of the commands used during the building of the web app

- A Django project is a collection of applications and configurations that wehn combined, make up the full web application ie. site + logic
- A django application is created to perform a specific function for the website. These are re-useable by us or by other people.

- To create an app run: 

	python manage.py startapp app_name

- This creates a django app folder with some files and folders:

	1. __init__.py
	2. admin.py :used to register models to be used with django's admin interface
	3. apps.py :application specific configs
	4. models.py : applications data models
	5. tests.py :test functions for the app
	6. views.py :functions that handle requests and return responses
	7. Migrations :database info relating to the models

- Django uses the ModelViewTemplate architecture design pattern (MVT).

- NEXT: 

	1. Specify that this new app exists by adding it to the project settings.py file
	2. Create a view and map it to a url
