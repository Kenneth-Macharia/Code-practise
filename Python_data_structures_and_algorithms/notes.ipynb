    "- Data structures and algorithms is a study area of the theoretical computer science field in the discipline of computer science.\n",
    "- An algorithm is a proceedure or fomula for solving a problem.\n",
    "- Big-O notation: a notation that compares algorithm based on how fast they run and how much memory (space) they use  to run, independent of hardware. It examines how **quickly an algorithm's runtime grows** (not exact runtimes)realtive to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large, also known as the algorithm's complexity.\n",
    "- An algorithm's complexity can either be time (above) or space (amount of resource it uses in computing a result)\n",
    "- Time complexity can be determined by evaluating the number of assignmnents/ operations an algorithm makes relative to the input size.\n",
    "- Big-O uses the 'n' notation to represent input size, so that various input sizes can be used to analyze the alogrithm's growth.\n",
    "- As n becomes arbitrarily large, the concern is only on the terms that grow the fastest relative to n thus constants are not conisdered in big-O notation analysis.\n",
    "- Big-O is analysis is considered asymptotic (describing limiting behaviour) i.e a function f(n + 1) may considered asymptotically equal to to another f(n) as the value of n becomes arbitrarily large or as the limit is approached.\n",
    "- Common Big-O notations/ functions that can be used to evaluate an algorithm are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "  1. Constant time O(1): the computation time does not grow when the input size grows e.g. reading a value from a          variable takes the same time as reading a value from a list of 1000 items.\n",
    "  2. Linear time O(n): the computation time scales linearly with the input size e.g accessing all the items in a          list, via a loop.\n",
    "  3. Quadratic time O(n):the computation time scale twice as much relative to the size of the input e.g \n",
