-Arithmetic operators in JavaScript: + - * / =(assignment)
-Allowed operations: += -= *= /+
 -Unary operations: i.e: a = a + 1; > a++; also a--; which adds one to a, if used
  in console.log() then the original value of a gets printed. To add the one and
  print out the updated value use ++a; Also: --a;
-(NB) NaN > 'not a number' appears in console when you try to use an operator,
 other than '+' on operands that are not of type 'number'.
-Conditional statements: if statements:
    if (condition) {
      do something
    } else {
      do something else
    }
  -Conditional operators: == (equal), === (strict equality test for contents
   including type), < <= => >, != (not equal), !== (strict no eqaulity test)
  -Boolean conditions:
    1.True: ie. if (a == false) {} or if (a) {}
    2.False: ie. if (a != true) {} or if (!a) {}
  -Logical operators: use to evaluate two logical conditions ie.:
    1.AND > && eg. if (a==b && c==d){} Both conditions MUST be TRUE for the entire
     expression to evaluate to TRUE.
    2.OR > || eg. if (a==b || c==d){} Either the 1st or the 2nd or both MUST be
      TRUE for the condition to evalute to TRUE.
    3.XOR (Does not exist in Javascript) Either the 1st or the 2nd ONLY must be
     TRUE for the expressin to evaluate to TRUE. eg. if((a==b || c==d) && (a==b
     != c==d))
  -Ternary Operator: condition ? true action : false action eg. a==b ? console.log
   ('Match') : console.log('No match'). Ensure it' use is readale to humans and
   where it's not obvious use comments.
-Array: variable type that can hold many items at the same time, of different types.
